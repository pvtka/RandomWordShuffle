# Random Word Shuffle Analyzer

## Description
This Python program is designed to analyze the permutations generated from a 5-letter word input by the user. It checks if the input consists exclusively of lowercase letters and meets the required length. If the input does not match these criteria, the user is prompted to try again. Once a valid word is entered, the program shuffles its letters 1200 times, tracking the frequency of each unique permutation. It then reports the total number of unique combinations generated, identifies the most and least common permutations, and saves these results, along with the input word and the permutation dictionary, to a text file named `result.txt`.

## Features
- Validates user input to ensure it's a 5-letter word composed of lowercase letters.
- Performs 1200 random shuffles of the word's letters.
- Tracks the frequency of each unique permutation in a dictionary.
- Reports the total number of unique permutations generated.
- Identifies and displays the most and least common permutations.
- Saves the input word, permutation dictionary, and details about the most and least common permutations to a text file `result.txt`.
